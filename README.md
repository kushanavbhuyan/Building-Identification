# Building Elements-at-risk Identification

Stat-update: 0.2

This repository is an on-going hub for my master thesis materials and codes regarding the detection and characterisation of building elements-at-risk. Will be updating it every other week or so with more codes, materials, data and pre-processing updates.

Stat-update: 0.3

The repository is almost finished and is being updated with final notebooks and full-datasets. 

### Information about buildings is, sufficed to say, a very important aspect not just for urban land registry or transportation but also for disaster/hazard risk assessment. Specifically, typological attributes of buildings like number of residents living in them, number of floors, and many more. The MSc Thesis Research aims at figuring out the typological attributes of the buildings by incorporating deep learning and other proxy information as a means of detecting and characterising the buildings.
